# mnist-dnn
This project is about exploring deep learning networks, with a primary goal of getting my computer to "dream", as seen in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M&t=23m30s

cli/dump-arrays.js reads in a (hardcoded) [mnist data file](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and translates it into a json file contining an array of arrays containg the raw data for each image.


It's not clear what the licence for the mnist data is, but any mnist data in this repo retains it's original licencing (and will be removed on request).
